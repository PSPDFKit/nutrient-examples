## PSPDFKit assets

In order to make the example work, the PSPDFKit assets need to be copied from their original location in `./node_modules/pspdfkit/dist` to `./static`. This is done automatically from a postinstall script in located in `./scripts/copy-pspdfkit-files.js`.

In case copying the files fails, you can copy them manually:

- Copy `./node_modules/pspdfkit/dist/pspdfkit.js` to `./static/pspdfkit.js`.
- Copy `./node_modules/pspdfkit/dist/pspdfkit-lib/` to `./static/pspdfkit-lib/`.

That's it!
